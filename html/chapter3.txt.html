<p>What does the following function do?
<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">add(X, Y) when is_integer(X), is_integer(Y) -&gt; X + Y.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>add/2 will only add together X and Y if they are both integers.</p>

<hr>

<p class="first">How does <em>add/2</em> know if X and Y are integers?</p>

<p>add/2 uses two guards to perform checks on the variables. A guard is a way to test a variable being passed to a function.  In the case of add/2, the guard being used is the BIF(built in function) is_integer which will return true if the variable is an integer and false if it is not. We can add guards to function definitions by using the key word &quot;when&quot; followed by the guard or guard sequence that we would like to perform.</p>

<hr>

<p class="first">Does add/2 use a guard or guard sequence?</p>

<p>add/2 uses a guard sequence since it uses two tests.  You separate these tests with commas.</p>
