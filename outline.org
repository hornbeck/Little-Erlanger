Might be worth defining:

Intended Audience: Professional developers looking to learn Erlang but not wanting a heavy book.

Book Goals: What do we want people to come away with from this book?  What about this book would make
people recommend it to others?  I think we have a good start in it's unique Q&A format.

I think the main goal for me is to bring the format of the little schemer to erlang. The little
schemer was very easy to read and fun. Not only that but it was short. A 200 page book can be
read over a weekend and with the little schemer you could work the examples as you went. It was 
also a very lite reading.
